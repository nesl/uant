Underwater Acoustic Networking plaTform (UANT)

UANT uses GNU Radio for physical layer communication
and TinyOS for a MAC layer. This provides configurability
at both the PHY and MAC layers. UANT can be assigned an IP 
address from Linux allowing for a full TCP/IP stack.
Applications can not only be run from Linux but also
TinyOS applications can be run through a TOSSIM simulation.

The uant.pl is a perl-tk GUI that allows you to enter the configurable
parameters and start the underwater modem. Currently the
TinyOS application RadioCountToLeds is used along with the option
for linux applications.

To use:
$ sudo su
# source uant_vars
# ./uant.pl

Important note about time:
If you are only using applications from Linux there is no need
to throttle the TOSSIM simulation. If the simulation is throttled
the performance is hurt quite dramatically (factor of 5-10). However if
running a TinyOS application it is important to throttle the simulation
otherwise the notion of time in on the running nodes will not match
"wall" time.

Currently throttle is disabled in the 'linux' app that does not run 
TinyOS application and is enabled otherwise.
To toggle throttle on/off please see UWTos.c and (un)comment the necessary lines.
