Underwater Acoustic Networking plaTform (UANT)

Network and Embedded System Laboratory (NESL)
University of California Los Angeles


UANT uses GNU Radio for physical layer communication
and TinyOS for a MAC layer. This provides configurability
at both the PHY and MAC layers. UANT can be assigned an IP 
address from Linux allowing for a full TCP/IP stack.
Applications can not only be run from Linux but also
TinyOS applications can be run through a TOSSIM simulation.

The uant.pl is a perl-tk GUI that allows you to enter the configurable
parameters and start the underwater modem. Currently the
TinyOS application RadioCountToLeds is used along with the option
for linux applications.

To use:
$ sudo su
# source uant_vars
# ./uant.pl [OPTIONS]
